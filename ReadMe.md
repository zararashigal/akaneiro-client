# About

This is the game client for [Akaneiro: Demon Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaneiro:_Demon_Hunters) developed by Spicyhorse. (c) SpicyHorse
This fork was made to ensure the game continues eventhough it didn't live up to expectations. I think it deserves to live. That's my opinion. FORKED by Zarashigal 2024
